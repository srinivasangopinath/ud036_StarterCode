This program helps to create a website that displays the set of favorite movies. 
The list of movies are shown as posters and when clicked, the movie plays the movie trailer.
media.py is the python module that holds the definition/template of the movie class 
(all the attributes, variables and methods are defined in the class).
entertainment_center.py is the python module that holds all the name of the movie object based 
on the class Movie to display in a website.

the six movie object posters as in picture "Movie Page 1", "Movie Page 2", "Movie Page 3".
